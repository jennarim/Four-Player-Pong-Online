## Built with
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web application framework for Node.js
* [React](https://reactjs.org) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io) - JavaScript library for realtime web applications

## Challenges
As the state of the game (e.g. where the ball is, did the ball pass the goal?) is constantly changing, SocketIO involves heavy interaction with both client and server. As a result, I learned more about safely maintaining state and the value of hiding implementation details between the client and server.
